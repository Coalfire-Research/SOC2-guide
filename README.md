## Decisions

### Type 1 or Type 2.

"In a SOC 2 Type 1 audit, a startup defines its best practices. Type 1 essentially presents a snapshot of security controls at a certain point in time. It collects evidence that shows the security controls that have been put in place and how the company is fulfilling them."

"In a SOC 2 Type 2 audit, a startup produces a sample set of evidence that proves its security controls have been followed over time. Type 2 is a six-month to a year longitudinal audit that evaluates the constancy of controls through the lens of security."

### Scope of Audit

What parts of the company will be SOC 2 compliant? Maybe exclude your marketing efforts.
